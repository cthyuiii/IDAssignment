### Documentation and research done

##### User Audience
My website is mainly a portfolio website mainly stating my freelance services.

When users come and visit they intend to have some sort of work they need help to be done or,
intend to hire me for help in their company.

##### Who is the website catering for?
I would say employers, contractors from companies that require help in frontend code, business assistance, fashion design or modelling.
My website provides and display infomation on these as users scroll more in the work section.
I also gave convincing and short descriptions below each section.
